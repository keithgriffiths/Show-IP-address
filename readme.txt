The idea is simple, give it a go, let me know what you think of this plugin. Any suggested updates I'll consider in each build.

#### Great for:

#### This is a FREE plugin

This simply shows the IP address of a visitor if they land on a specific page, you simply put your tag where you want your visitor to see there IP address, and that's it!
